``` Text
Physical Barbs: The word "barb" often refers to a sharp projection extending backward
(as from the point of an arrow or fishhook), intended to make it harder for the object
to be removed. A good example is barbed wire, which is wire with clusters of short,
sharp spikes set at intervals along it, used to make fences or barriers.

Critical Remarks: In a conversational or literary context, "barbs" can refer to critical
or pointed comments meant to hurt, criticize, or provoke someone. This comes from the
idea of the remark being as sharp and painful as a physical barb.

Fish Anatomy: In the context of biology, a "barb" can refer to a slender, whiskerlike
sensory organ near the mouth found in certain fishes, such as catfish and carp.
